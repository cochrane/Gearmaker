Gearmaker
=========

A quick-and-dirty tool to create 3D files of involute gears.

Currently, the language is a weird mixture of english and german. That should probably be changed. Files are output in OBJ. The faces have varying (and possibly enormous) amounts of vertices, but they're all convex. Have fun!
